# What is NodeJS?

Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project! A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.

When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, or accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.

# What is PM2?

PM2 is a production process manager for Node.js applications with a built-in load balancer. It allows you to keep applications alive forever, to reload them without downtime, and to facilitate common system admin tasks.

# What is Angular?

A component-based framework for building scalable web applications.
A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more.
A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code
With Angular, you're taking advantage of a platform that can scale from single-developer projects to enterprise-level applications. Best of all, the Angular ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7 million developers, library authors, and content creators.
